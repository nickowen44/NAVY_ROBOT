# NAVY_ROBOT
Royal Australian Navy Tank Project 

The GUI was designed in processing 3.4 for windows 64bit 
It utilities the ControlP5 2.2.6 and video 1.0.1

the will have to be added to your build or else the code will not compile 
this can be done though sketch-> Import library -> Add library 
you will have to restart your computer after installing these libraries in processing.

It is also important to note that the GUI consumes or requires a fair amount of the processes power to maximise the effectiveness and responsiveness of the program ensure you don't have other memory intensive programs open such as media players or web browsers 


The Tank / Robot / Camera Software 
Was written in the Arduino IDE running on a Makeblock MegaPi board that is arduino Mega2650 compatible
